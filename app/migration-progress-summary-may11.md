# Migration Progress Summary - May 11, 2025

## Completed Today

1. Fixed JavaScript bridge files for tournament event handlers:
   - Fixed `pauseHandler.js` bridge file by removing `.ts` extension
   - Fixed `disconnectingHandler.js` bridge file
   - Fixed `resumeHandler.js` bridge file
   - Fixed `startHandler.js` bridge file
   - Fixed `joinHandler.js` bridge file

2. Fixed frontend issues:
   - Fixed `setSnackbar` error in `/src/app/live/[code]/page.tsx` by replacing with individual state setters

3. Converted tournament utility files to TypeScript:
   - Converted `/sockets/tournamentUtils/scoreUtils.js` to TypeScript with proper type annotations
   - Converted `/sockets/tournamentUtils/computeStats.js` to TypeScript with proper type annotations

4. Created JavaScript bridge files for newly converted modules:
   - Created bridge for `scoreUtils.ts`
   - Created bridge for `computeStats.ts`

5. Verified build processes:
   - Successfully built the project with `npm run build`
   - Fixed type errors related to missing types

## Next Steps

1. Convert the remaining tournament utility files:
   - `/sockets/tournamentUtils/tournamentTriggers.js`
   - `/sockets/tournamentUtils/tournamentHelpers.js`
   - `/sockets/tournamentUtils/computeLeaderboard.js`
   - `/sockets/tournamentUtils/sendTournamentQuestion.js`

2. Convert core event registration modules:
   - `/sockets/tournamentHandler.js`
   - `/sockets/tournamentEvents.js`

3. Convert remaining quiz event handlers in `/sockets/quizEventHandlers/`

4. Implement stricter TypeScript options in tsconfig.json for improved type safety

## Notes

- Had to make careful adjustments to types when importing from tournamentTypes.ts and quizTypes.ts
- Added proper typing for arrays and improved null safety
- Used TypeScript's non-null assertion operator (!) where appropriate to handle potential undefined values
- Created proper interfaces for return types of utility functions
