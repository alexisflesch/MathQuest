# TypeScript Migration Status - May 11, 2025

## Overall Progress

*   **JavaScript (.js) files in `sockets/`:** 87
*   **TypeScript (.ts) files in `sockets/`:** 33
*   Many utility and event handler files in `sockets/tournamentUtils` and `sockets/quizEventHandlers` have been converted, but a significant number of `.js` files (including legacy bridges) remain.

## Recently Completed (as of May 11, 2025)

*   Fixed JavaScript bridge files for several tournament event handlers (`pauseHandler.js`, `disconnectingHandler.js`, `resumeHandler.js`, `startHandler.js`, `joinHandler.js`).
*   Fixed a frontend issue with `setSnackbar` in `/src/app/live/[code]/page.tsx`.
*   Converted `/sockets/tournamentUtils/scoreUtils.js` and `/sockets/tournamentUtils/computeStats.js` to TypeScript.
*   Created bridge files for the newly converted `scoreUtils.ts` and `computeStats.ts`.
*   Verified build processes and fixed related type errors.
*   Resolved build errors in `quizEvents.ts`, `quizTriggers.ts`, `tournamentEventHandlers/answerHandler.ts`, and `quizEventHandlers/setTimerHandler.ts` by adjusting imports, exports, and type annotations.

## Next Steps

1.  **Refactor `quizUtils.ts`:**
    *   Convert CommonJS exports to ES module exports.
    *   Update the legacy `require` for `tournamentState.legacy.js` to an ES module import from `tournamentState.ts`.

2.  **Review and Finalize Existing TypeScript Conversions:**
    *   Verify that the TypeScript versions of files previously part of the migration plan (e.g., `tournamentTriggers.ts`, `tournamentHelpers.ts`, `computeLeaderboard.ts`, `sendTournamentQuestion.ts`, `tournamentHandler.ts`, `tournamentEvents.ts`) are complete, correct, and that their `.js` bridge files (if any) are functioning as expected.

3.  **Convert Remaining JavaScript Files in `sockets/` Directory:**
    *   Prioritize conversion of remaining `.js` files in `sockets/quizEventHandlers/`.
    *   Convert other core `.js` files and utilities within the `sockets/` directory.
    *   Systematically replace `.legacy.js` files with TypeScript equivalents and update imports.

4.  **Implement Stricter TypeScript Options:**
    *   Update `tsconfig.json` (and potentially `tsconfig.backend.json`) with stricter compiler options (e.g., `strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`) for improved type safety and code quality. Address any new errors that arise.

5.  **Clean Up Old Progress Files:**
    *   Consider archiving or deleting older migration tracking files (`migration-progress-summary-may11.md`, `migration-progress-summary.md`, `typescript-conversion-tracker.md`) to avoid confusion.

## Notes

*   Careful adjustments to types are needed when importing from `tournamentTypes.ts` and `quizTypes.ts`.
*   Continue to add proper typing for arrays and improve null safety.
*   Use TypeScript's non-null assertion operator (`!`) judiciously.
*   Create proper interfaces for return types of utility functions.
