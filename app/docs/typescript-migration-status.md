# TypeScript Migration Status - May 12, 2025

## Overall Progress

*   **JavaScript (.js) files in `sockets/`:** 85
*   **TypeScript (.ts) files in `sockets/`:** 35
*   Many utility and event handler files in `sockets/tournamentUtils` and `sockets/quizEventHandlers` have been converted, but a significant number of `.js` files (including legacy bridges) remain.

## Recently Completed (as of May 12, 2025)

*   Converted `/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/sockets/lobbyHandler.js` to TypeScript.
*   Converted `/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/sockets/quizHandler.js` to TypeScript.
*   Fixed imports in `quizHandler.ts` to use named exports from `quizEvents.ts`.
*   Updated mixed module patterns in various TypeScript files to ensure compatibility with the bridge files.
*   Resolved path alias issues in bridge files by consistently using the `@logger` path alias instead of relative paths.
*   Resolved path alias issues in `server.ts` by updating `tsconfig.backend.json` path configurations and successfully compiled.
*   `server.ts` is now considered fully functional.
*   Ensured `tournamentState`, `registerQuizHandlers`, and `quizState` are correctly exported from their respective handler modules (`tournamentHandler.ts`, `quizHandler.ts`).
*   Corrected argument list for `registerTournamentHandlers` in `server.ts`.
*   Resolved TypeScript errors during compilation and improved type safety.
*   Verified that the application builds and runs correctly with the TypeScript conversions.
*   Converted `tournamentEvents.js` to TypeScript.
*   Determined that `register-ts-handlers.js` is no longer necessary and has been removed.
*   Removed test files `test-quizstate-imports.js` and `test-timer-sync.js` as they were no longer needed.

## Previous Accomplishments (as of May 11, 2025)

*   Fixed JavaScript bridge files for several tournament event handlers (`pauseHandler.js`, `disconnectingHandler.js`, `resumeHandler.js`, `startHandler.js`, `joinHandler.js`).
*   Fixed a frontend issue with `setSnackbar` in `/src/app/live/[code]/page.tsx`.
*   Converted `/sockets/tournamentUtils/scoreUtils.js` and `/sockets/tournamentUtils/computeStats.js` to TypeScript.
*   Created bridge files for the newly converted `scoreUtils.ts` and `computeStats.ts`.
*   Verified build processes and fixed related type errors.
*   Resolved build errors in `quizEvents.ts`, `quizTriggers.ts`, `tournamentEventHandlers/answerHandler.ts`, and `quizEventHandlers/setTimerHandler.ts` by adjusting imports, exports, and type annotations.

## Remaining Files to Convert

### Core Files
- ~~`/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/server.js` -> `server.ts`~~ (Completed, server.js to be removed)
- ~~`/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/register-ts-handlers.js` -> `register-ts-handlers.ts`~~ (Removed)
- `/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/db/index.js` -> `db/index.ts` (Completed)
- ~~`/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/test-quizstate-imports.js` -> `test-quizstate-imports.ts`~~ (Removed)
- ~~`/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/test-timer-sync.js` -> `test-timer-sync.ts`~~ (Removed)

### Quiz Event Handlers - Legacy Files
These files will need to remain as JavaScript files if they support legacy functionality, but should be reviewed to ensure they properly import from their TypeScript counterparts:
- `/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/sockets/quizEventHandlers/*.legacy.js` (11 legacy files)

### Tournament Handler Files
Most tournament handler files have already been converted to TypeScript, but the following should be reviewed to ensure JavaScript bridge files correctly import from their TypeScript counterparts:
- All 6 tournament event handlers in `/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/sockets/tournamentEventHandlers/*.js` bridge files
- All tournament utility files in `/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/sockets/tournamentUtils/*.js` bridge files

### Legacy Utility Files
- `/home/aflesch/mathquest/app/sockets/quizUtils.legacy.js` (review compatibility with TypeScript version)

## Next Steps

1.  **Convert Remaining Core Files:**
    * Start with `db/index.js` as it's the simplest (Completed)
    * Convert `server.js` with careful attention to imports (Completed)
    * Convert test files (`test-quizstate-imports.js` and `test-timer-sync.js`) - (Removed)
    * ~~Evaluate whether `register-ts-handlers.js` is still necessary after full TypeScript conversion~~ (Completed: Removed)

2.  **Review Bridge Files for Consistency:**
    *   Ensure all bridge files (like `tournamentEvents.js` and `quizTriggers.js`) correctly import from their TypeScript counterparts.
    *   Verify that `quizUtils.legacy.js` functionality is properly implemented in `quizUtils.ts`.
    *   Confirm that empty files (`quizUtils.js`, etc.) are intended as placeholders or bridge files.

3.  **Optimize and Standardize Bridge Files:**
    *   Ensure all bridge files follow a consistent pattern with proper error handling
    *   Use path aliases (`@logger`) consistently across all bridge files
    *   Document the bridge pattern for other developers to follow when creating new modules
    *   Prepare a plan for systematically removing bridge files once all features are confirmed working

4.  **Review and Finalize Existing TypeScript Conversions:**
    *   Verify that the TypeScript versions of all files are complete, correct, and their bridge files (if any) are functioning as expected.

5.  **Implement Stricter TypeScript Options:**
    *   Update `tsconfig.json` (and potentially `tsconfig.backend.json`) with stricter compiler options (e.g., `strictNullChecks`, `noImplicitAny`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`) for improved type safety and code quality. Address any new errors that arise.

## Conversion Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - `db/index.js` - Simple database connection module that will be easy to convert (Completed)
   - `server.js` - Core application entry point, critical for the application (Completed)

2. **Medium Priority**
   - ~~`test-quizstate-imports.js` - Test file that should be updated for TypeScript compatibility~~ (Removed)
   - ~~`test-timer-sync.js` - Test file that should be updated for TypeScript compatibility~~ (Removed)

3. **Low Priority**
   - ~~`register-ts-handlers.js` - May become obsolete after full TypeScript conversion~~ (Marked for removal)

## Notes

*   The application is now running with a mix of TypeScript and JavaScript files, with bridge files handling the compatibility.
*   Most socket handler components have been migrated to TypeScript, but there are still some core files and legacy handlers that need conversion.
*   Consider reviewing compile-time vs. runtime behavior to ensure TypeScript conversions don't introduce subtle bugs.
*   When fixing TypeScript errors, focus on ensuring type safety without breaking runtime behavior.
*   Path aliases (`@logger`, `@sockets/*`, `@db/*`) should be used consistently across all files.
*   Once all core files are converted to TypeScript, the `register-ts-handlers.js` file ~~may become~~ is unnecessary.
*   Legacy `.js` files should be kept for backward compatibility but should be updated to import from their TypeScript counterparts.
