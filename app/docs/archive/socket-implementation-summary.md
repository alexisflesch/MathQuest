# Socket.IO Implementation Summary 

## Completed Features

### Phase 5: Real-time Core Logic (Socket.IO Setup)
- Successfully integrated Socket.IO with the Express server in `server.ts`
- Configured CORS and transport settings for different environments
- Set up Redis adapter for Socket.IO to support horizontal scaling
- Implemented authentication middleware for socket connections
- Created connection/disconnection event handlers
- Developed room management utilities for joining/leaving rooms with Redis persistence
- Added tests for Socket.IO connections and room utilities

### Phase 6: Lobby Implementation (Socket.IO)
- Implemented lobby handler (`lobbyHandler.ts`) for managing game lobby participation
- Added socket events for joining/leaving lobbies and retrieving participant lists
- Set up Redis-based state persistence for lobby participants
- Created periodic game status checks to redirect players when games start
- Added proper cleanup logic for when players disconnect
- Implemented test structure for lobby functionality

## Next Steps

### Phase 7: Game Logic (Socket.IO)
- Implement the `gameHandler.ts` for managing live game play
- Add socket events for joining games, submitting answers, etc.
- Develop question serving and timer management logic
- Set up answer processing and scoring
- Implement leaderboard updates
- Store game state in Redis for persistence across multiple server instances
- Create appropriate tests for game logic

### Phase 8: Teacher Dashboard & Game Control
- Develop the `teacherControlHandler.ts` for managing teacher interactions
- Implement socket events for teacher control of games
- Create synchronization logic between teacher dashboard and player views
- Add appropriate tests for teacher control functionality

## Notes
- All implementations follow the TypeScript-first approach with proper type safety
- Redis is used throughout for state persistence and horizontal scaling
- Authentication is properly handled for both teachers and players
- Room-based broadcasting is used for efficient real-time updates
- The code is modular and follows clean architecture principles
